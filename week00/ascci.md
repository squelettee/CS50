## ASCII and Unicode

ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. It's a character encoding standard originally developed in the 1960s to standardize the representation of text in computers and communication equipment. ASCII uses 7 bits to represent characters, allowing for a total of 128 different characters, including letters, numbers, punctuation marks, and control characters.

However, as computer technology advanced and the need for more characters and symbols arose, ASCII's limitations became apparent. This led to the development of Unicode, which is a more comprehensive character encoding standard capable of representing characters from multiple languages and writing systems.

Unicode uses a variable-length encoding scheme, allowing it to represent a much larger number of characters compared to ASCII. It supports characters from various scripts, including Latin, Cyrillic, Greek, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, and many more.

The transition from ASCII to Unicode was driven by the need for a universal character encoding standard that could accommodate the diverse linguistic and cultural requirements of modern computing. Unicode has become the de facto standard for character encoding in most contemporary software and systems, enabling seamless communication and interoperability across different languages and platforms.
